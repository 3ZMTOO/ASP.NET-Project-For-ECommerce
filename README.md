# ASP.NET-Project-For-ECommerce
A source code repository for an ASP.NET Core API supporting ecommerce tasks like product management, order processing, user authentication, and payment integration. Follows RESTful principles for easy client application integration. Documentation included.
### Key Components and Technologies Used:

- **RESTful APIs:**  
  Leveraged RESTful principles throughout the project to ensure clear communication and interoperability with client applications. This approach facilitates seamless integration and scalability.

- **Onion Architecture:**  
  Implemented the Onion Architecture pattern to promote maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns. This architectural style organizes the application into layers, each with distinct responsibilities, facilitating easier testing and future modifications.

- **Unit of Work and Specification Design Pattern:**  
  Utilized the Unit of Work pattern to manage database transactions effectively, promoting consistency and atomicity. Additionally, employed the Specification Design Pattern to encapsulate query logic, enabling dynamic and reusable querying of data.

- **Pagination:**  
  Integrated pagination functionality to enhance the user experience by efficiently managing large datasets. This feature improves performance and navigability, particularly in scenarios involving extensive data retrieval.

- **Redis Caching:**  
  Implemented Redis caching to optimize data retrieval operations and enhance application performance. By storing frequently accessed data in-memory, Redis reduces database load and latency, resulting in faster response times and improved scalability.

- **Identity and JWT for Authorization:**  
  Incorporated ASP.NET Identity for user management and authentication, ensuring secure access to resources. Additionally, utilized JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication, enabling secure and efficient authorization across distributed systems.

- **Stripe for Payment Processing:**  
  Integrated the Stripe payment gateway to facilitate secure and seamless payment transactions. By leveraging Stripe's robust APIs and features, the application ensures reliable payment processing while maintaining PCI compliance and data security.

- **Controllers:**  
  The project comprises five main controllers:
    - **Basket Controller:** Manages shopping baskets and cart-related operations.
    - **Account Controller:** Handles user account management functionalities.
    - **Order Controller:** Facilitates order processing and management.
    - **Payment Controller:** Orchestrates payment processing and transaction handling.
    - **Products Controller:** Provides endpoints for managing product-related operations.
